# Vrinda Store Sales Data Analysis
The Vrinda Store Sales Analysis Excel project provides insights into the performance of the store, the most popular products, and the behavior of customers to help make informed decisions about product offerings, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

In this data analysis project I have used Microsoft Excel to analyze the sales data of Vrinda Store, a fictional retail store. The project includes several worksheets with different types of analysis to help gain insights and make informed decisions.
